#### Rob-64 
*is a robot from one of my favourite N64 games and has very little to do with what's in this Repo.

This is a Extra-terrestrial Robot Code Kata.

I've never had the chance to try out TDD despite working in some pretty hostile JS environments. 
The closest I've come to is writing uber defensive code and putting some form of Type checking in (TypeScript, Flow)

But this is no good, is it? It still means it's hard for me to reason about design decisions and 'get going'.

I also love React, so thought I'd learn TDD under the Jest Framework.

#### Running Tests

At the moment, this is all this guy does. THere's no app yet, soz.

To get started:
`npm install`
`jest`
