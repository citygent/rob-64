#### Rob-64 
*is a robot from one of my favourite N64 games and has very little to do with what's in this Repo.

This is a Extra-terrestrial Robot Explorer Code Kata. It's very similar to the Java [Karel the Robot exercise](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1146/textbook.shtml)

I've never had the chance to try out TDD despite working in some pretty hostile JS environments. 
The closest I've come to is writing uber defensive code and putting some form of type checking in (TypeScript, Flow)

But this is no good, is it? It still means it's hard for me to reason about design decisions and 'get going'.

I also love React, so thought I'd learn TDD under the Jest testing framework.

#### Running Tests

At the moment, tests is all this guy does. There's no app yet, soz.

To get started:
```
npm install
jest
```
